# How to play

Based on the concept of [pancake sorting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancake_sorting), the object of the game is to sort all the pancakes from largest (on the bottom) to smallest (on top) in as few flips as possible.
Click the button of the corresponding pancake to flip it and all of the above pancakes.
